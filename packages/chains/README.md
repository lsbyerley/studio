> Info on Tableland supported chains and helpers to get node providers.

## Background

This package is a single file that stitches wagmi and viem together to configure the Studio supported chains with RPC Providers like Alchemy and Infura.

## Install

You can install via npm.

```
npm install @tableland/chains
```

## Usage

The entire package is contained in [src/index.ts](https://github.com/tablelandnetwork/studio/blob/main/packages/chains/src/index.ts). You might find it easiest to read through that file.
There are two functions exported:

- `configuredChains`: takes one optional boolean argument indicating if a localhost chain should be included, default is `false`. Returns the chains studio supports with provider urls configured
- `supportedChains`: takes one optional boolean argument indicating if a localhost chain should be included, default is `false`. Returns the chains studio supports

## Development

See the `web` package for how the chains are used in the context of Studio.
