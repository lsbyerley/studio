> Studio specific data store.

## Background

This package contains the schemas of the data used for the operation of Studio. For a quick start on what the Studio data store looks like read through the [schemas](https://github.com/tablelandnetwork/studio/blob/main/packages/store/src/schema/index.ts)

## Install

You can install via npm, but this is a store designed, specifically, for Studio, so it is not recommended to use this package outside of the Studio.

```
npm install @tableland/studio-store
```

## Usage

## Development

All of the data in Studio is publicly readable. If you're curious you can directly query the Studio tables using any of the Tableland read query tools.
